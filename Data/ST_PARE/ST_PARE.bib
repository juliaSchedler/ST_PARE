	abstract = {Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are modeled and examined for spatial structure using different spatial models.},

	abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

	abstract = {Flood forecasting may be improved by coupling atmospheric and hydrological models. To investigate the current potential of such an approach in complex mountain watersheds, the authors carried out a number of combined high-resolution one-way driven model experiments to generate runoff hydrographs for seven extreme flood events which occurred in the Lago Maggiore basin between 1993 and 2000. The Alpine Ticino–Verzasca–Maggia basin (2627km2) is located directly to the south of the main Alpine ridge embracing a great part of the drainage area of Lago Maggiore. For this basin, the grid-based hydrological catchment model WaSiM-ETH was employed to determine the continuous runoff hydrographs. In the model experiments, two different sets of meteorological input data were used: (1) surface observation data from station measurements and from weather radar, and (2) forecast data from five different high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with grid cell sizes between 2 and 14km. This paper presents and compares selected results of these flood runoff simulations with particular attention to the experimental design of the model coupling. The configuration and initialization of the hydrological model runs are outlined as well as the down-scale techniques which proved to provide an adequate spatial interpolation of the meteorological variables onto the 500m×500m grid of the hydrological model. In order to evaluate the various hydrological model results as generated from the different outputs from the five NWP models, some coupled experiments with ‘non-standard’ NWP model outputs have been carried out. In particular, the results of these sensitivity studies point to inherent limits of high-resolution flood runoff predictions in complex mountain terrain.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the spatial relationships in sociological and epidemiological applications is an important tool in the analysis of urban data. While point level data (e.g. observations at a given latitude/longitude) provide the most detail about spatial phenomenon, spatial data aggregated to the level of relevant municipal regions is easily accessible and can provide insights at a level useful for policy decisions for governments and communities. This work identifies two areas of focus in the analysis of spatially aggregated data. First, a new specification for dependence in spatial regression models for aggregated data using the Hausdorff distance and extended Hausdorff distance is introduced. The new dependence structure is shown to account for the shape and orientation of the irregular and disconnected regions often encountered in practice and evaluated in the context of model performance as well as a real data example. An R package compatible with existing spatial packages which implements the construction of spatial weight matrices generated using the (extended) Hausdorff distance is provided along with a vignette illustrating its use on real data. Second, the idea of a spatial case-crossover model is explored in the context of connection to existing spatial methods. A method for including spatial dependence in a spatio-temporal case-crossover model is also explored.},

Modeling the underlying spatial process as normal on the log scale is sensible; point kriging allows the whole region of interest to be mapped. However, mining and precision agriculture is carried out selectively and is based on block averages of the process on the original scale. Finding spatial predictions of the blocks assuming a lognormal spatial process has a long history in geostatistics. In this article, we make the case that a particular method for block prediction, overlooked in past times of low computing power, deserves to be reconsidered. In fact, for known mean, it is optimal. We also consider the predictor based on the “law” of permanence of lognormality. Mean squared prediction errors of both are derived and compared both theoretically and via simulation; the predictor based on the permanence-of-lognormality assumption is seen to be less efficient. Our methodology is applied to block kriging of phosphorus to guide precision-agriculture treatment of soil on Broom's Barn Farm, UK.},

	abstract = {Rainfall extreme value analysis provides information that has been crucial in characterizing risk, designing successful infrastructure systems, and ultimately protecting people and property from the threat of rainfall-induced flooding. However, in the Houston region recent events (such as the unprecedented rainfall wrought by Hurricane Harvey) have highlighted the inability of existing analyses to accurately characterize current climate conditions. Specifically, there has been little research investigating how spatial patterns of extreme precipitation have shifted through time in the Texas Gulf Coast region, which has led to mis-characterization of existing intensity–duration–frequency curves. This study investigates spatiotemporal trends in extreme precipitation in southeast Texas using a statistical approach for peaks-over-threshold modeling that employs a generalized Pareto distribution. Precipitation data from over 600 rain gauges across the region are analyzed in 40-year time windows to evaluate shifts in distribution parameters and extreme rainfall levels through time. Spatial analysis of these trends focuses on highlighting regions with increasing, stationary, and decreasing extreme rainfall through time. Results demonstrate heterogeneity in spatiotemporal trends across the entire study region, but significant increases in extreme rainfall over the Houston urban area. Spatial analysis of these trends focuses on how extreme rainfall has changed within different watersheds. Return level estimates of extreme rainfall values are also compared to the current standards for Harris County. Results from this study identify areas that have experienced significant shifts in extreme rainfall, and can help inform where design standards may be inaccurate or outdated.},

We construct a spatial weights matrix, W, based on the principle that spatial structure should be considered in a two-part framework, those units that evoke a distance effect, and those that do not. Our two-variable local statistics model (LSM) is based on the Gi* local statistic. The local statistic concept depends on the designation of a critical distance, dc, defined as the distance beyond which no discernible increase in clustering of high or low values exists. In a series of simulation experiments LSM is compared to well-known spatial weights matrix specifications—two different contiguity configurations, three different inverse distance formulations, and three semi-variance models. The simulation experiments are carried out on a random spatial pattern and two types of spatial clustering patterns. The LSM performed best according to the Akaike Information Criterion, a spatial autoregressive coefficient evaluation, and Moran's I tests on residuals. The flexibility inherent in the LSM allows for its favorable performance when compared to the rigidity of the global models.},

	abstract = {A typical feature of the land surface is its heterogeneity in terms of the spatial variability of land surface characteristics and parameters controlling physical/hydrological, biological, and other related processes. Different forms and degrees of heterogeneity need to be taken into account in hydrological modelling. The first part of the article concerns the conditions under which a disaggregation of the land surface into subareas of uniform or “quasihomogeneous” behaviour (hydrotopes or hydrological response units – HRUs) is indispensable. In a case study in northern Germany, it is shown that forests in contrast to arable land, areas with shallow groundwater in contrast to those with deep, water surfaces and sealed areas should generally be distinguished (disaggregated) in modelling, whereas internal heterogeneities within these hydrotopes can be assessed statistically, e.g., by areal distribution functions (soil water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, etc.). Models with hydrotope-specific parameters can be applied to calculate the “vertical” processes (fluxes, storages, etc.), and this, moreover, for hydrotopes of different area, and even for groups of distributed hydrotopes in a reference area (hydrotope classes), provided that the meteorological conditions are similar. Thus, a scaling problem does not really exist in this process domain. The primary domain for the application of scaling laws is that of lateral flows in landscapes and river basins. This is illustrated in the second part of the article, where results of a case study in Bavaria/Germany are presented and discussed. It is shown that scaling laws can be applied efficiently for the determination of the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) of the surface runoff system in river basins: simple scaling for basins larger than 43km2, and multiple scaling for smaller basins. Surprisingly, only two parameters were identified as important in the derived relations: the drainage area and, in some cases, the elevation a.s.l.. The scaling exponent was determined as equal or approximately equal to the exponent 0.566 in Hack’s law. Therefore, it is suggested that there is some relation between the scaling laws and the fractal nature of river networks, and accordingly with the complex dynamics of the interacting hydrological and geomorphological processes in river basins.},

The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003.},

The change of support problem is concerned with inference about the values of a variable at points or blocks different from those at which it has been observed. In the context of block data which can be sensibly viewed as averaging over point data, we propose a unifying approach for prediction from points to points, points to blocks, blocks to points, and blocks to blocks. The approach includes fully Bayesian kriging. We also extend our approach to the the case of spatio-temporal data, wherein a judicious speciﬁcation of spatio-temporal association enables manageable computation. Exempliﬁcation of the static spatial case is provided using a dataset of point-level ozone measurements in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. The dynamic spatial case is illustrated using a temporally extended version of this dataset, enabling comparison at the common time point.},

	abstract = {The formulation of conditional probability models for finite systems of spatially interacting random variables is examined. A simple alternative proof of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem is presented and the theorem is then used to construct specific spatial schemes on and off the lattice. Particular emphasis is placed upon practical applications of the models in plant ecology when the variates are binary or Gaussian. Some aspects of infinite lattice Gaussian processes are discussed. Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples. It is maintained throughout that the conditional probability approach to the specification and analysis of spatial interaction is more attractive than the alternative joint probability approach.},

	abstract = {Extreme value analysis (EVA) is essential to evaluate the extreme events brought on by natural hazards in the environment. Particularly, EVA informs risk assessment for communities, which is crucial to protecting people and property. This work focuses on an application to extreme rainfall in the Houston, TX region and Harris County, and performs spatiotemporal extreme value modeling in order to assess the evolution of extremes over time for the region. Rainfall extreme values are compared to previous standards in order to demonstrate the need for updated policies. In addition to the temporal evolution of EVA, a key component of this work is the introduction of new methods to extend extreme value modeling at the point observation level to the areal level. The methods employ spatial statistics change-of-support concepts and the use of the extended Hausdorff distance to provide estimates of the extreme value distribution at the region level. Regional inference provides insight to support policy decisions for communities and cities.},
