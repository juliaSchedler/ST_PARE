# Point-to-Area Random Effects {.unnumbered}

Link to this [project's Github Repo](https://github.com/juliaSchedler/ST_PARE) (contains all datasets).

This site is a guided tutorial on fitting the Point-to-Area Random Effects model as part of the paper "Spatial-Temporal Extreme Modeling for Point-to-Area Random Effects (PARE)," presented at SDSS 2023 and submitted to the accompanying special issue of the Journal of Data Science. The model fit here is described in detail in Section 3.2.1 of the paper.

This paper is concerned with modeling extreme values when data are available at the point level, but results are desired at the areal level.
